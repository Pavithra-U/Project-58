        <h3> Being able to record memories is one of the major reasons why I love photography. Photography has expanded my view of the world and helped to me to see the underlying oneness in everyone.
          <section>I love photography because it makes me feel one with nature or one with the people who are subjects of my photography.they connect us to our past, they remind us of people, places, feelings, and stories.</section>
          <section>I enjoy photography because it is something that I can do any time, any place and all I need is my phone. I enjoy photography because it has allowed me to capture moments in my own life that I don't want to forget.</section>
          
          <section>A photo can simply capture a precious moment of one's life and make that moment last forever in the minds of people</section>
          
          <section>A photograph helps to form beautiful stories of life through the captured images but requires a thorough knowledge of the subject</section>
